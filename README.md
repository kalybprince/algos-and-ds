My goal is to become a full-stack web developer.
To do so, I will learn javascript syntax and use
it as my primary language for learning algorithms
and data structures.

## Step 1 - Learn javascript syntax and core features

Learn and implement the following:

- Data types, control flow, OOP, etc.
- Built-in methods
- Advanced concepts (modules, promises, etc.)

**NOTE:** Do an assignment on array iteration methods

## Step 2 - Implement any and all objects/D.S. in javascript
