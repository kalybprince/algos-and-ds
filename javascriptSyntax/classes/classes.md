# Class analysis

**Note:** it's crucial to understand that **JavaScript
classes are primarily "syntactic sugar" over JavaScript's
existing prototype-based inheritance model**. They don't
introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model but
provide a cleaner, more organized syntax for what was
previously achieved with constructor functions and
prototypes.

1. What is a Class? (Syntactic Sugar for Prototypes)
2. `constructor()` Method
3. Class Methods
4. Creating Instances (`new` Keyword)
5. Inheritance (`extends` and `super`)
6. Static Methods and Properties (ES2015 for methods, ES2022 for properties)
7. Public and Private Class Fields (ES2022)
8. Getters and Setters
9. `instanceof` Operator
